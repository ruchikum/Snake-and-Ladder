# Snake-and-Ladder
Snakes and ladders is an ancient Indian board game that’s regarded today as a worldwide classic. It requires two or more players and takes place on a board with numbered, gridded squares. Throughout the board, there are snakes and ladders which connect different squares. Players roll a die and navigate the board. Landing on a ladder advances a player to a square further up the board, while landing on a snake means they have to go back to a previous square.

The aim of the game is to reach the final square. The game is a race that’s based on sheer luck, and is popular with children.
Requirements for building the game include UI elements such as a board, coins, buttons, and a display info area
Back end logic requirements include a data structure to represent the board, snakes, and ladders, a dice for player movement, and a player with certain properties
Javafx will be used for the user interface and Java for the back end logic
Javafx is used to build GUIs and is intended to replace Java Swing as a GUI framework
Javafx provides more functionalities than Swing and has its own components that are independent of the operating system.
